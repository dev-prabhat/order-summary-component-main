## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

While building this is project , I learned some Semantic html tags like main , section and after deep dive into Semantic i get to know about that while building any project or web we should try to use these tags main, section , header , footer and aside , there are many more but all I remember are these this time

In CSS , by which we can make our website beautiful , here I learn about how to select a tag to apply CSS properties also how to select children tag in a parent tag to apply common CSS properties . Typography plays an important role to make any website symmetric(can't get the exact word)  

### Continued development

There are many things to learn in my Frontend Developer journey , but firstly I wann make sure that i can create website responsive with respect to multiple screens so that it looks perfect or tends to perfect
